# Cloud Learning syllabus (to apply for Junior/Medior position)

### This is a repo for learning essential cloud topics for emigration and get a job offer in the cloud space!
As you know, digital transformation has become essential for businesses to remain in the market. In recent years, a rapid transformation happens in the IT business, and many companies are adopting new technologies. Cloud and DevOps are two significant trends we hear a lot in the line of transformation. So, working on these two trends can be very effective for IT Engineers to properly swap their skills to the new technological trends. I want to continue with introducing a basic roadmap and make a clear picture of the long cloud journey. It definitely save a lot of time and accelerate their learning and gaining the goal. 

Based on my experience in one of the top financial organization in Europe where we have already embarked on their digital transofrmation journey, I try to simplify a roadmap for IT infra engineers to apply for Azure Cloud Engineer or Azure DevOps Engineer roles.

Learning syllabus is just highlighted based on imporant requirement, however there are a huge number of topics in DevOps process which will be out of our scope for Junior position. Note that, becoming senior or master in DevOps or Azure needs more experience and knowledge. Therefore, my initial intention is to speed up learning process and preparing IT Engineers to enter to the cloud market as quickly as possible! (6-12 month)
#### In our journey, we will focus on Azure as a cloud platform, and Azure DevOps as the main tools for enabling of DevOps mindset!
